# Mayvue Assessment

I've added Swagger to make testing and development easier. It can be accessed at http://localhost:5000/swagger. There are also several unit tests for the data access object.

A create script can be found at the root of the repo. I was unable to provide a database back-up due to permission issues with the school provided laptop.

Hopefully you enjoy Marvel more than DC since my test data is exclusively MCU.
